🌐 Rolando Muñoz — Portfolio Website

A responsive and modern personal portfolio built with HTML + Tailwind CSS (CDN) and interactive JavaScript.
The design features smooth transitions, dark/light mode, a mobile navigation panel, and a project gallery — all built using utility-based styling directly inside the HTML.

This project reflects my ability to design and develop clean UI layouts, structure content, and deploy static web projects efficiently.
